% this the median filtered image was flat fielded. This requires blurring the 
% image then subtracting the blurred image from the original.

% Of these flat-fielded images, the one that used sigma=100 gave the best 
% balance between leveling the illumination and preserving shape. If we apply 
% local contrasting again, the

% indicating the position of hair cells.

% Next we will apply a small binary close to solidify the cells followed 
% by a larger binary open to remove small pixel noise. Finally, a small dilation 
% will be applied to make sure that the selection includes the entire hair cells.
