function [test,labels,NeighborsMask] = IsNeighbor(MaskA,MaskB,PixDistance,varargin)
%ISNEIGHBOR determines if the connected components in MaskA are neighbors
%of the connected components in MaskB within a distance (PixDistance). 
%   [test,NeighborsMask] = IsNeighbor(MaskA,MaskB,PixDistance) determines 
%   if the connected components in MaskA  are within a distance
%   (PixDistance) of the connected components in MaskB. Outputs a logical
%   vector indicating which of the connected components in MaskA are
%   determined to be neighbors (1) and which are not (0). The set of labels
%   that correlate the test vector to MaskA, and a new mask that consists
%   of only components in MaskA that were determined to be neighbors with
%   the components in MaskB.
