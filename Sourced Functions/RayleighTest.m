function [pvalue,RayleighsR,z] = RayleighTest(angs)
%RAYLEIGHTEST Test null hypothesis that circular distribution is uniform.
%   [pvalue,Ray,z] = RAYLEIGHTEST(AngleVector) tests whether the
%   distribution of angles (IN DEGREES) in the input AngleVector is significantly
%   different from a uniform distribution. Outputs Rayleighs R,
%   Rayleigh's z (z) which is the test statistic for the Rayleighs Test,
%   and the approximate p-value for the Rayleigh Test Statistic. This
%   approximation is outlined in (Zar, J.H. (1999). Biostatistical Analysis
%   (4th Edition) p. 617. The null hypothesis is rejected if the p-value
%   calculated is less than the specified significance level ? e.g. ?=0.05.
